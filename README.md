![HTML5 EPUB Reader](/etc/logo.png "Rile.js")


Rile.js is a small HTML5 EPUB file reader.
This project is still an early alpha, so most of the EPUB files will probably not display correctly or work at all.

This project begun partially as a research project and partially as a tool for my fiancée’s writing [blog](http://www.pagesfilledwithletters.com/ "Pages Filled With Letters"). The name “Rile.js” comes directly from her first [short story](http://www.pagesfilledwithletters.com/2012/12/merry-christmas-and-undefeated-john-rile.html "The Undefeated John Rile")

###TODO
 - Write tests
 - Better page slicing - the slicing methods are not yet ready, they still need some love.
 - Asynchronous pages slicing - because nobody likes when the UI freezes on large documents.
 - Remembering the current page between page reloads.
